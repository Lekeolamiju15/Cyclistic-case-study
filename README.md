# Cyclistic-case-study
This analysis is based on the Divvy case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy and Data Visualization" written by ADELEKE OLAMIJU . The purpose of this script is to analyse Cyclistic downloaded Divvy data into a single dataframe and then conduct simple analysis to help answer the key question: “In what ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?”
